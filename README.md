# Advanced Voice Assistant  

## Overview  
The **Advanced Voice Assistant** is an AI-powered system designed to automate daily tasks, provide intelligent responses, and enhance user convenience. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to understand user commands, supports multi-language interactions, and incorporates context-aware capabilities for seamless conversations.  

## Features  
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversational continuity by remembering prior interactions.  
- **Task Automation**: Handles tasks like setting reminders, retrieving information, and controlling IoT devices.  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Interacts with users in multiple languages for a broader user base.  
- **Voice Interaction**: Natural and intuitive communication via voice commands.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **NLP Frameworks**:  
  - `spaCy` for natural language understanding  
  - `NLTK` for intent recognition and text preprocessing  
- **Speech Recognition**: `SpeechRecognition` library for converting voice commands to text  
- **Text-to-Speech**: `pyttsx3` for converting responses to speech  
- **APIs**: Integrated APIs for fetching weather updates, managing reminders, and interacting with IoT devices  

## How It Works  
1. **Speech Input**: Captures the user’s voice command using a microphone.  
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Converts the voice input into text using the SpeechRecognition library.  
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Processes the text to determine the intent using spaCy or NLTK.  
4. **Task Execution**: Based on the identified intent, the assistant executes tasks such as:  
   - Setting reminders  
   - Fetching information  
   - Controlling smart devices  
5. **Context Awareness**: Stores session data to maintain conversational flow for follow-up queries.  
6. **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the assistant’s response into speech for user interaction.
